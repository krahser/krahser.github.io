My name is Vizcaino, Aldo María. I came to China to study traditional kung fu. 

I'm from Gral. La Madrid, Buenos Aires, Argentina. After to study and work in La Plata with computers I decide to work on my mind and my body.

When I was 12 years old, and I got my first computer, my life changed a lot.
I been learning since that. At the beggining, without a teacher, I just play arround until I get my first job in an ISP on my little town. After that I decide to study computer science to contribute to build a better world.
My big challenge was end my carrer, becouse I had to work to live. But, that work give me the oportunity to keep learning and be an open source contributor and Free Software lover.
I have develop a frontend to build ansible playbooks, but I'm not happy with the UX. So I'm coding on that again. 
To do that I thougth "I need more diciplin and improve my healty". That is the reason why I'm in wudangshan training kung fu.
